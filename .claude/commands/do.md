# /do

**Skills:** `/signal` (mark/warn/dissolve outcomes) · `/typedb` (query tasks, write pheromone)

> **Before anything else:** Read `docs/TODO.md`.
> It is the mission briefing — active fronts, top priority, what's built, where we're going.
> Load it once per session. Let it orient the work.

Drive work through the substrate — select and execute.

## Modes

| Mode | What | Loop |
|------|------|------|
| `<intent>` | Natural language → find context → fastest path | L1, L2 |
| `<TODO-file>` | Advance next wave of the TODO (wave-at-a-time) | L1, L2 |
| `<TODO> --auto` | Run W1→W4 continuously until all cycles done | L1, L2 |
| `<TODO> --wave N` | Run a specific wave (override auto-detect) | L1, L2 |
| *(empty)* | Autonomous loop: pick → execute → mark → repeat | L1, L2 |
| `--once` | Single iteration of the autonomous loop | L1, L2 |

---

## Intent Mode — `/do <natural language>`

When arguments are NOT a TODO filename, --auto, --wave, --once, or empty,
treat them as **intent** and route to the fastest execution path.

### Step 1: Extract Topic

Parse the intent into a **topic slug** (kebab-case, 2-4 words max):

```
"create a landing page"     → landing-page
"fix the auth middleware"   → auth-middleware
"add payment tracking"      → payment-tracking
"refactor the loop"         → loop
```

### Step 2: Search for Context

Search for existing files matching the topic (run in parallel):

```bash
# Pattern 1: TODO files
glob "**/TODO*{topic}*.md" | head -5

# Pattern 2: Spec/plan docs
glob "**/*{topic}*.md" | head -10

# Pattern 3: Source files (for fix/refactor intents)
glob "**/*{topic}*" --type ts,tsx,astro | head -10

# Pattern 4: Task mentions in one/
glob "one/**/*{topic}*.md" | head -5
```

Collect: `{ todos: [], specs: [], sources: [], tasks: [] }`

### Step 3: Reflect — What Do We Have?

| Found | State | Fastest Path |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| TODO file exists | Execution queued | → Use existing TODO mode |
| Spec exists, no TODO | Spec defines scope | → Create TODO from spec, then execute |
| Sources exist, no spec | Code is the spec | → Direct execution (simple) or create TODO (complex) |
| Nothing exists | Greenfield | → Ask user for scope OR create minimal TODO |

**Complexity heuristic** (determines TODO vs direct):
- "create" / "add" / "build" → likely needs TODO (multi-wave)
- "fix" / "update" / "tweak" → likely direct execution
- "refactor" → read scope first, then decide

### Step 4: Report and Route

Output a reflection block before proceeding:

```
┌─ /do intent: "{original intent}"
│
│  Topic:   {topic-slug}
│  Found:   {N} TODOs, {M} specs, {K} sources
│
│  Context:
│    • {file1} — {one-line summary}
│    • {file2} — {one-line summary}
│    ...
│
│  Decision: {direct | create-todo | use-existing}
│  Rationale: {why this path is fastest}
│
└─ Proceeding with: {next action}
```

### Step 5: Execute

**If TODO exists:** Switch to `<TODO-file>` mode with that file.

**If spec exists, no TODO:**
1. Read the spec fully
2. Extract: goal, scope, constraints, exit criteria
3. Create `docs/TODO-{topic}.md` using the TODO template
4. Populate cycles/waves from spec structure
5. Switch to `<TODO-file>` mode with new TODO

**If sources exist, no spec (simple):**
1. Read the relevant source files
2. Execute the fix/update directly
3. Run `bun run verify`
4. Mark outcome via `/close`

**If sources exist, no spec (complex):**
1. Read the relevant source files
2. Create minimal TODO with one cycle
3. Switch to `<TODO-file>` mode

**If nothing exists:**
1. Ask: "No existing context for '{topic}'. What's the goal? (one sentence)"
2. Create `docs/TODO-{topic}.md` with user's answer as the goal
3. Switch to `<TODO-file>` mode

---

## Routing

`/do` maps to `select()` + the tick loop — driving signals through the
deterministic sandwich. Every execution closes its loop per Rule 1:
mark() on result, warn() on failure, warn(0.5) on dissolved, neutral on timeout.

| Mode | Primitive | Termination |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `<intent>` | search → reflect → route | routes to one of below |
| `<TODO>` | wave handler | one wave completes |
| `--auto` | wave handler × N | all cycles complete |
| `--wave N` | wave handler | one wave completes |
| empty | `select()` | user interrupts |
| `--once` | `select()` | one task completes |

## Wave-Aware Model Routing

Every task has a `task-wave` attribute (W1/W2/W3/W4) that drives model selection:

| Wave | Model | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| W1 | Haiku | Recon — fast parallel reads, pattern detection |
| W2 | Opus | Decide — complex reasoning, tradeoffs |
| W3 | Sonnet | Edit — precise refactors, code synthesis |
| W4 | Sonnet | Verify — consistency checks, rubric scoring |

When selecting next task, use `task.task-wave` to route the execution to the correct model.
Fallback to `EFFORT_MODEL` (Sonnet) if `task-wave` is absent.

---

## Skill Pre-flight Check

**Before executing ANY task**, verify required skills exist and are current.
This prevents mid-execution failures due to missing capabilities.

### Step 1: Infer Required Skills

Extract skills from task tags, intent, and file types:

```
Task tags: [ui, landing, astro]     → skills: [/astro, /shadcn, /react19]
Task tags: [typedb, schema]          → skills: [/typedb]
Task tags: [sui, wallet, bridge]     → skills: [/sui]
File types: *.astro, *.tsx           → skills: [/astro, /react19]
Intent: "create a landing page"      → skills: [/astro, /shadcn]
```

**Skill inference map:**

| Tag/Pattern | Required Skill | Why |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| `ui`, `component`, `*.tsx` | `/react19` | React 19 patterns |
| `astro`, `page`, `*.astro` | `/astro` | Astro 6 + CF Workers |
| `shadcn`, `card`, `badge` | `/shadcn` | shadcn/ui components |
| `typedb`, `schema`, `tql` | `/typedb` | TypeDB 3.0 syntax |
| `sui`, `wallet`, `move` | `/sui` | Sui Move contracts |
| `graph`, `flow`, `node` | `/reactflow` | ReactFlow patterns |
| `deploy`, `worker`, `cf` | `/deploy` | Cloudflare deploy |
| `api`, `sdk`, `anthropic` | `/claude-api` | Claude API patterns |

### Step 2: Check Skill Status

For each required skill, check:

```bash
# Skill exists?
ls .claude/skills/{skill-name}/ 2>/dev/null

# Skill is current? (modified within 30 days)
find .claude/skills/{skill-name}/ -mtime -30 -type f | head -1
```

**Status categories:**

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `ready` | Skill exists, recently updated | Proceed |
| `stale` | Skill exists, > 30 days old | Suggest refresh |
| `missing` | Skill doesn't exist | Create or skip |
| `external` | Skill from MCP/plugin | Check MCP connection |

### Step 3: Report Skill Status

Output skill check before execution:

```
┌─ Skill Pre-flight
│
│  Required: /astro, /shadcn, /react19
│
│  Status:
│    ✓ /astro      ready    (updated 2d ago)
│    ✓ /shadcn     ready    (updated 5d ago)
│    ⚠ /react19    stale    (updated 45d ago)
│
│  Action: Proceed with warning — /react19 may need refresh
│
└─ Continuing...
```

### Step 4: Handle Missing Skills

**If skill is missing but required:**

```
┌─ Skill Pre-flight
│
│  Required: /sui
│
│  Status:
│    ✗ /sui        missing
│
│  Options:
│    1. Create skill: /skill new sui (scaffold from template)
│    2. Skip task: This task requires Sui knowledge
│    3. Proceed anyway: Risk of incorrect Move syntax
│
└─ Choice? [1/2/3]
```

**Auto-create for common patterns:**

If the missing skill matches a known template in `.claude/skills/templates/`:
- Offer to scaffold it immediately
- Or fetch from skill registry if available

### Step 5: Refresh Stale Skills

**If skill is stale (> 30 days):**

```
┌─ Skill Refresh Suggested
│
│  /react19 last updated 45 days ago
│
│  Recent changes in ecosystem:
│    • React 19.1 released (check for new patterns)
│    • use() hook behavior clarified
│
│  Options:
│    1. Refresh now: Re-read React 19 docs, update skill
│    2. Proceed: Use current skill (may be outdated)
│    3. Skip: Don't use this skill for this task
│
└─ Choice? [1/2/3]
```

### Integration with Execution

The skill check gates execution:

```
/do "create a landing page"
     │
     ▼
┌─ Intent Mode ─────────────────────┐
│  Topic: landing-page              │
│  Found: plan-landing.md           │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
     │
     ▼
┌─ Skill Pre-flight ────────────────┐
│  Required: /astro, /shadcn        │
│  Status: ✓ ready, ✓ ready         │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
     │
     ▼
┌─ Execute ─────────────────────────┐
│  Running W3 of plan-landing.md    │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**If skills not ready, execution pauses** until resolved. This prevents:
- TypeDB 2.x syntax in a 3.x schema (missing `/typedb`)
- React class components in a hooks codebase (stale `/react19`)
- Move 1.0 patterns in a Move 2.0 contract (missing `/sui`)

---

## Steps

### `<TODO-file>` — Wave execution

Pass a TODO filename as `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g. `/do TODO-commands.md`).
If no argument given, use the most recently modified `docs/TODO-*.md` (excluding TODO-template.md).

Read `docs/<TODO-file>`. Find the current cycle and wave by scanning the Status section
for the first unchecked `- [ ]` wave entry. Execute that wave:

**W0 — Baseline (before first wave of any new cycle)**

```bash
# 1. Verify the starting state is clean
bun run verify   # biome check . && tsc --noEmit && vitest run

# 2. Capture baseline metrics — W4 diffs against these
bun run build 2>&1 | tee /tmp/w0-build.txt
BUILD_MS=$(grep -oE '[0-9]+ms' /tmp/w0-build.txt | tail -1 | tr -d 'ms')

# Bundle sizes (Astro + Worker)
CLIENT_KB=$(du -sk dist/_astro/*.js 2>/dev/null | awk '{sum+=$1} END{print sum}')
WORKER_KB=$(du -sk .wrangler/output/*.js 2>/dev/null | awk '{sum+=$1} END{print sum}')

# Agent/skill body sizes — token proxy (lines × ~4 tokens/line)
AGENT_LINES=$(find agents -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
SKILL_LINES=$(find web/src -name '*.md' 2>/dev/null | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')

# Write baseline — W4 reads this file
cat > .w0-baseline.json <<EOF
{
  "cycle": $(grep -c '## [0-9]' docs/improvements.md 2>/dev/null || echo 0),
  "buildMs": ${BUILD_MS:-0},
  "bundleKB": { "client": ${CLIENT_KB:-0}, "worker": ${WORKER_KB:-0} },
  "agentLines": ${AGENT_LINES:-0},
  "skillLines": ${SKILL_LINES:-0},
  "tests": { "passed": $(grep -oE '[0-9]+ passed' /tmp/w0-build.txt | tail -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+' || echo 0) },
  "lighthouse": "run-at-w4"
}
EOF
```

Record: tests passed/total, any known failures. Fix before proceeding. Don't build on broken ground.
`.w0-baseline.json` is the anchor — W4 compares every metric against it.

---

**W1 — Recon (Haiku, parallel)**

1. **Seed from prior W4** — read `.w4-improvements.json` if it exists. Every open improvement
   from the last cycle becomes a mandatory recon target for this cycle. If an item has appeared
   in 3+ consecutive cycles unfixed, flag it as a systemic gap in your W1 report.

   ```bash
   cat .w4-improvements.json 2>/dev/null || echo "no prior improvements"
   ```

2. Read the TODO's Wave 1 section for the current cycle
3. Spawn ALL recon agents **in a single message** using the Agent tool with `model: "haiku"`
   — include the open improvement files as mandatory reads alongside the TODO's recon targets
4. Each agent reads one file and reports findings verbatim with line numbers
5. Hard rule for each agent: "Report verbatim. Do not propose changes. Under 300 words."
6. Collect all reports
7. Mark Wave 1 complete in the Status section: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`

Log: `W1: tasks_parallel=N  marked=N  warned=N  dissolved=N`
CLOSE: `/close --todo <slug> --wave 1` — emit `do:close` [`cycle:N`, `wave:1`, `todo:<slug>`]; append to learnings.md (soft gate).

---

**W2 — Decide (Opus, main context)**

1. You ARE the decider. Do not delegate this wave.
2. Read all W1 reports + the source-of-truth doc referenced in the TODO
3. **Tag the TODO type** — add to the TODO header if absent:
   `type: refactor | fix | feature | doc`
   This controls the Simplicity benchmark in W4 (see `one/rubrics.md` Code Rubric §3).
4. **Focus check** — for every file in the diff spec, state its current line count.
   If the edit will make it noticeably large, ask: "is this file doing one thing?"
   If two responsibilities are visible, split in the plan now — not in W3.
   Reference: the entire substrate (schema + engine) is 200 lines total. A file
   that needs more than that is almost certainly doing more than one thing.
   This is a thinking prompt, not a line limit. Name splits here; W3 executes them.
5. For each finding, decide: **Act** (produce anchor + new text) or **Keep** (it's an exception)
6. Output diff specs:
   ```
   TARGET:    docs/foo.md
   ANCHOR:    "<exact old text>"
   ACTION:    replace
   NEW:       "<new text>"
   RATIONALE: "<one sentence>"
   ```
5. Mark Wave 2 complete

Log: `W2: decisions=N  fan_out=N`
CLOSE: `/close --todo <slug> --wave 2` — emit `do:close` [`cycle:N`, `wave:2`, `todo:<slug>`]; append to learnings.md (soft gate).

---

**W3 — Edits (Sonnet, parallel)**

1. Read the diff specs from Wave 2
2. Spawn ALL edit agents **in a single message** using the Agent tool with `model: "sonnet"`
3. Each agent gets: file path, anchor (exact old_string), replacement, and the rules:
   "Use Edit tool with exact anchor as old_string. Do not modify anything else.
   If anchor doesn't match, report dissolved.
   If the edit makes the file noticeably large and you can see two responsibilities,
   report dissolved with reason 'file needs splitting — W2 to name the two files'.
   The goal is focused files, not a line count."
4. Collect results — mark successful edits, warn on anchor mismatches
5. Re-spawn dissolved agents once with corrected anchors (read the file first)
6. Mark Wave 3 complete

Log: `W3: edits_parallel=N  marked=N  warned=N  dissolved=N  reloops=N`
CLOSE: `/close --todo <slug> --wave 3` — emit `do:close` [`cycle:N`, `wave:3`, `todo:<slug>`]; append to learnings.md (soft gate).

---

**W4 — Verify (Sonnet, single)**

1. **Deterministic checks first:**
   ```bash
   bun run verify   # biome + tsc + vitest
   ```
   If any check fails on files touched in W3, route failure back to W3 (max 3 loops).

2. Spawn ONE verification agent (`model: "sonnet"`) — reads all touched files and checks
   cross-consistency per the TODO's verify checklist
3. Agent scores code rubric: security / stability / simplicity / speed (each 0–1, gate at ≥ 0.65)
   — full checks defined in `one/rubrics.md` Code Rubric section
4. If clean → mark Wave 4 `[x]` → mark cycle `[x]`
5. If inconsistencies → spawn micro-edit agents (Wave 3.5) → re-verify (max 3 loops total)

Log: `W4: rubric={security, stability, simplicity, speed}  composite=<N.NN>  velocity=<±N.NN>  lighthouse={perf,a11y,bp,seo}  tokens={cacheHit%,agentLinesDelta,skillLinesDelta}  verify=green|red`
CLOSE: `/close --todo <slug> --wave 4` — emit `do:close` [`cycle:N`, `wave:4`, `todo:<slug>`]; append to learnings.md (soft gate).

---

**After each wave:**
- Update TODO Status section (`[x]`)
- Report: `{ marked: N, warned: N, dissolved: N }`
- If all 4 waves complete: run cycle close — `/close --todo <slug> --cycle N` (**hard gate**: emit `do:close` [`wave:gate`], verify learnings.md grew by 1 entry, block next cycle if skipped). Then report "Cycle N complete."
CLOSE: (cycle gate) `/close --todo <slug> --cycle N` — **hard gate**; missing close → `do:close-missing` dissolved; `/do --auto` halts.
- If all cycles complete: "All cycles complete."

**Rules:**
- Never skip W2. Understanding is not delegable.
- Always spawn W1 and W3 agents in a SINGLE message — this is how you get parallelism.
- W4 max 3 loops. If still failing after 3, halt and report to user.

---

### `--auto`

Same as `<TODO-file>` but runs W1→W2→W3→W4 continuously until all cycles are marked `[x]`.
Stop only if W4 loops > 3 (escalate to user). Report cycle completion after each.

### `--wave N`

Force a specific wave (1–4) regardless of the Status section.
Useful for re-running a failed wave or skipping ahead.

---

### *(empty)* — Autonomous loop

```
W0: bun run verify (once per session, skip if already passed)

ORIENT: Read docs/TODO.md
        → note the active front (Atomicity / Vocabulary / New Surfaces)
        → note the Top 15 priority list
        → let this shape which task you pick

loop:
  SENSE:    GET http://localhost:4321/api/tasks
            Sort by priority (effective = score + strength − resistance)
            Skip blocked tasks (blockedBy non-empty)

  SELECT:   Pick highest unblocked (P0 > P1, attractive > ready > exploratory)
            If all blocked: GET /api/state → follow pheromone highways (deadlock escape)

  EXECUTE:  Do the work (edit files, write code, run scripts as needed)

  VERIFY:   bun tsc --noEmit on touched files

  MARK:     POST http://localhost:4321/api/tasks/{id}/complete

  CLOSE:    POST http://localhost:4321/api/loop/close { score: rubric }
            Score code rubric: security / stability / simplicity / speed (each 0–1)
            Composite: 0.35·security + 0.30·stability + 0.25·simplicity + 0.10·speed

  DIMS:     POST http://localhost:4321/api/loop/mark-dims { security, stability, simplicity, speed }
            Dims < 0.5 → warn on that dimension path
            Dims ≥ 0.5 → mark on that dimension path

  FEEDBACK: POST http://localhost:4321/api/signal {
              receiver: 'loop:feedback',
              data: {
                tags: task.tags,         // what kind of work this was
                strength: rubricAvg,     // how well it went (avg of 4 dims)
                content: { task_id, rubric, outcome: 'result' }
              }
            }
            // The return-path signal — lays pheromone on the trail home.
            // Future select() with matching tags follows this trail.
            // strength >= 0.65 → mark each tag path
            // strength < 0.65 → warn(0.5) each tag path (try specialist)
            // Always emit — even timeout, even dissolved. Every loop closes.

  GROW:     GET http://localhost:4321/api/highways → report learned paths

  → repeat
```

After each task: report name, strength, priority, tests passed, unlocked tasks.

### `--once`

Single iteration of the autonomous loop above.
Pick one task → execute → mark → stop.
Report: name, strength, priority, tests, deterministic outcome (result/timeout/dissolved/failure).

---

*`/do` is `select()` made human-readable. The path remembers every execution.*
